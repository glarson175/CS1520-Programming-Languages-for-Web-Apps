					<p>Website I worked on over my internship (Summer 2016)</p>
					<p class = "standard">I decided to include a link to the website that I worked on over summer at my internship.
					Over the summer of 2016 I worked for Intalere out in cranberry. They are a healthcare network, and I got to 
					help remake a subsidiary website. I included this because it shows my ability to learn on the job, and work with 
					starter code that I did not fully understand. Through this project I gained experience with DotNetNuke, html5, css, less, javascript/jquery, and C#.
					These are all important things to know and understand for a company searching to hire a web developer.
					Please visit the link below to see what I was a part of throughout my internship.</p>

					<p>File Sharing System (Java) for Cryptography class</p>
					<p class = "standard">I included a project I worked on this past semester (Fall 2016) for my Network security and cryptography class.
					I included this because it is one of the projects I am more proud of. This project showed my ablitiy to work with starter code that was not functioning properly initially. 
					It also was a group project and shows my ability to work with a team to get things done. In the real world of programming, most things are done in teams with the project broken into
					several parts. This is important for anyone working in the IT industry as I hope to some day. Please visit the link below to check out the code for the completed project.</p>

					<p>Branding Brand Cover Letter</p>
					<p class = "standard">This is the cover letter I wrote for a company I am pursueing called Branding Brand. Branding Brand is a ecomerce company who works with website and app development as well as in store purchasing. 
					I included this as a template for future cover letters, though I hope to get this job and stay there a while. Please click on the link below to view a copy of this cover letter. This is a good addition to my portfolio to show employers 
					of my ability to write professionally and concise. </p>

					<p>Rerences</p>
					<p>Ryan Sweeney - Manager, GPO Applications at Intalere</p>
					<p class = "standard">I chose Ryan as a contact because he was my supervisor at my internship. He is able to speak favorably to my character in the workplace, my desire to do work hard and my abitliy to learn quickly and do things well.</p>
					<p class = "standard">contact at: ryan.sweeney@intalere.com</p>
					<p>Nick Stephanovic - White Oak Campus Pastor, Word and Worship Church</p>

					<p>Bobby Folan - Assistant Swim Coach, Univesity of Pittsburgh</p>

					He would also be able to speak to my character as someone who wants to lead by example, will always work hard, and asks for correction instead of waiting for it to be given.</p>

					<p>Writing Samples</p>
					<p class = "standard">I decided to include two writing samples that I think highlight seperate but equally important aspects of myself. The first is a paper I wrote to dicuss a controversial issue 
					that was turned in with a job application. I included this because it shows my ability to think outside of the box and be creative but still logic based. The second is a paper I wrote talking about
					what it means to me to be professional. I put this in because it highlights my understanding of a professional workspace and how it should function. Please visit the listed links to be redirected to 
					my writing samples.</p>

					<p>School Uniform Proposal</p>
					<p class = "standard">This is a proposal I wrote to suggest a trial period of mandatory school uniforms for my school district of Penn Hills.
					I decided to propose this with a desire to see the crime and low graduation rate in my disctict be reveresed. And Uniforms have been shown to 
					decrease crime, especially gang related crime. As well as help students focus less on appearance and more on their studies, which logically would lead to better grades and higher graduation rates
					This could help me in my conversations with employeers for a few reasons. First it shows my ability to do research and make a plan for a change. And second, because it shows my care for my hometown which I hope shows good character. Please Click the link below to view my school uniform proposal.</p>

					<p>Powerpoint Presentation for above proposal</p>
					<p class="standard">This is the PowerPoint I put together quickly for a presentation that I gave to my Written Professional Communication class. This goes with the above proposal. I think this powerpoint shows my ability to get work done quickly, and still be 
					somewhat funny while I am at it. I think being able to bring a sense of humor to the workplace is a desireable trait in an employee so long as they remain professional and attentive to work. Please Click the link below to view my powerpoint presentation.</p>
